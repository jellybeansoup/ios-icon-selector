# IconSelector

A drop-in UI component to allow easy selection of alternate icons on iOS.

## Why?

Adding alternative icons to an iOS app isn't entirely straightforward, but it should be. It's tricky enough to add the entries to your Info.plist, let alone implement UI that you can display on both iPhone and iPad. This library takes care of that last part, and leaves you the much easier task of choosing the icons you want to add!

## Features

- Build on top of `UIControl`.
- Adjustable borders, padding, labels, etc.
- Drop in as-is, or use it to power custom UI.
- Compatible with iOS 10.3 and above.

## Installation

### [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) (for Apple platforms only)

In Xcode, select _File_ > _Swift Packages_ > _Add Package Dependency_ and enter the repository URL:

```
https://github.com/jellybeansoup/ios-icon-selector
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "jellybeansoup/ios-icon-selector"
```

## Getting Started

Begin by defining your alternate icons under the [`CFBundleIcons`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleicons) key within your app's `Info.plist` file. Don't forget to include an entry for your app's primary icon!

``` xml
<key>CFBundleIcons</key>
<dict>
	<key>CFBundleAlternateIcons</key>
	<dict>
		<key>blue</key>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
			<array>
				<string>blue-20</string>
				<!-- Include all the relevant sizes! -->
			</array>
		</dict>
	</dict>
	<key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
		<array>
			<string>green-83.5</string>
			<!-- Include all the relevant sizes! -->
		</array>
	</dict>
</dict>
```

Next, instantiate the IconSelector and add it to your view heirarchy. The `IconSelector` class inherits from `UIControl`, so you'll also need to add a target/action pair to be notified when the user selects a different icon.

``` swift
// Goes at the top of the file.
import IconSelector

// Retrieve all the icons defined in your app's main bundle.
let icons = Icon.main

// Instantiate the IconSelector with a target/action combo, and add it to your view hierarchy.
let iconSelector = IconSelector(icons: icons)
iconSelector.addTarget(self, action: #selector(iconSelectorDidChange(_:)), for: .valueChanged)
view.addSubview(iconSelector)
```

Finally, implement the action needed to change the app's icon in response to the user's selection.

``` swift
@objc func iconSelectorDidChange(_ iconSelector: IconSelector) {
	guard UIApplication.shared.supportsAlternateIcons, let selectedIcon = iconSelector.selectedIcon else {
		return
	}

	UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIcon(selectedIcon, completionHandler: nil)
}
```
