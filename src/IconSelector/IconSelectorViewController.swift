	/// 	are to indicate that an invalid icon was selected, so as long as the icons you provide during init are
	/// 	sourced from the Info.plist (the default option), you're golden.

	///   - iconSelector: The `IconSelector` that the `selectedIcon` was selected in.
	///   - error: The `Error` that was thrown by the system.
